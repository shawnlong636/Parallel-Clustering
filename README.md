#  Parallel Clustering: Optimized K-Means in Swift

Parallel Clustering is a demo application for an optimized, parallel implementation of K-Means clustering in Swift. 

### What is Clustering?

Clustering is a form of unsupervised machine learning in which a set of data is grouped into smaller subsets called clusters. One of the advantages of this type of learning over other forms of machine learning is that it does not require labeled data. This can be especially useful since more data than ever is being collected, but it takes a great deal of time and effort to manually clean and label data for digestion. One of the drawbacks of this 

### Optimizations

- Move clusterCount parameter to class variable
